#### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formating elements to plain text document. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is one of the world's most popular markup language.
Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.
### Why use Markdown?
You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.
- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.
### Some Basic Syntax to get started with Markdow
## Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without space around the letters.
I just love **bold text**
I just love __bold text__
I just love the bold**le**tters
## Italic
To italicise text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a phrase or word. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without space around the letters.
I love *italic* words
I love itali*c* words
## Blackquotes
To create a blackquote, add a > before the paragraph.
> This is just an example of a blackquote in Markdown.
## Blackquote with multiple paragraphs
Blackquoters can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank line between paragraphs. 
> This is just an example of blackquote in the Markdown.
>
> This is another example of the same.
## Nested Blackquote
> This is just an example of a blackquote.
>
>> This is an another **great** example of blackquote and bold text in the Markdown.
## Blackquotes with other elements
Blackquotes can contain multople Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used - You'll need to experiment to see which one works.
> ### Let's try ths example
>
> - Let's try another exampple
> - Let's try another example
> 
 *Everything* is just going according to the pl**an**.

## Lists
you can organize ordered and unordre lists.
## Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don't have to be in the numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
1. First item
2. Second Item
3. Third item
## Unordered List
To create unordered list, add dashes ` - `, asterisks, `*`, or plus sign `+`. 
- first item
  - second item
    - third item
